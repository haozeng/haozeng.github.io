<p> I am a web developer who loves using ruby to solve engineering problems. I've worked with numerous ruby projects, including rails and sinatra. I've spent most of my time working as a backend engineer and sometime I jump out of the backend role and also worked as a front-end developer. I am very familiar with Git/Linux and deploying various apps in heroku with different add-ons. Often, I need to get my hands dirty and act as a devOp, playing nginx and app server. </p>

<p> My next goal is to learn one functional programming language and want to apply things that I learned from functional language in my works. </p>

<p> I believe that the greatest developer should form his/her own dogmatics and should possess a strong likes/dislikes regardless of general popularity of certain tool. I have great respect the ones who possess these doctrine. </p>
