<p> I grew up in Sichuan, China. <img src = "../images/sichuan.png"> I came to US when I was 17 years ago for my college. My hometown is also the hometown of Panda <img src="../images/panda_2.jpg"> and it is famous for the spicy foods. <img src="../images/spicy_food.jpg"> </p>

<p> I went to Texas A&M for my college <img src='../images/a_m.jpeg' width='789'></p>
<p> Then three years ago, I went to Cal for my masters and stayed in Silican Valley since then. <img src='../images/uc_b.jpg'></p>

  <p> <img src="../images/dhh.jpg" style="float:right"> Today, I am a web developer who loves using ruby to solve engineering problems. I've worked with numerous ruby projects. I've spent most of my time working as a backend engineer and sometime I jumped out of the backend role and also worked as a front-end developer. I am very familiar with Git/Linux and deploying various apps using capistrano and heroku with different add-ons. Often, I need to get my hands dirty and act as a devOp, playing nginx and app server. </p>
  <p> I believe that the greatest developer should form his/her own dogmatics and should possess a strong likes/dislikes regardless of general popularity of certain tool. I have great respect the ones who possess these doctrine. </p>
  <p> My next goal is to master one functional language. </p>
