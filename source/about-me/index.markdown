<p> I was studying structural engineering at school, which is a mathematic-intensive engineering major. After a few internships in Structural Engineering Industry, I could not stand the fact that I can see myself in 20 years. I decided to change. </p>

<p> I am a self-starter. I started web development back when I was at UC Berkeley. Now I am a full stack developer, writing codes mainly in ruby and javascript, and often I got my hands dirty as a devOps, tweaking nginx, unicorn, and deployment process. </p>

<p> I've worked on numerous ruby and node.js applications, in which I followed TDD practice to design/write/maintain codes. I am a front-end developer as well, and I love coding in backbone.js and ember.js. </p>
